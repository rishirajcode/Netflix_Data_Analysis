I completed my engineering degree in 2022 from Dr. B.C. Roy Engineering College, where I studied in the Information Technology department. After graduating, I joined Capgemini as an analyst. Initially, I worked as a Database Administrator (DBA) on the VPK project. After about six months, I moved to my current project at Chanel.

During this time, I developed a strong interest in Power BI. I started taking various courses on platforms like Udemy and have created several projects using Power BI. I also contributed to projects on the Maven Challenge, an online project platform.

I am now looking to fully shift my career towards Power BI development. Recently, I spoke with Debalin Sir, who works on the same floor as I do. He suggested that I reach out to you for a reference since you manage the Power BI practice at Capgemini.
