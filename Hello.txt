Hello

I hope you are doing well.

I am Rishu Arya, and I work as a Senior Analyst at Capgemini in the role of Database Administrator. I graduated in 2022 from the Information Technology department at Dr. B.C. Roy Engineering College in Durgapur. 

I'm writing to express my keen interest in contributing to Power BI projects. I have been practicing Power BI for a long time and have completed multiple projects. Additionally, I have contributed to a few project competitions. 

In my current role, I've gained a deep understanding of SQL, which is a foundation for effective business intelligence. I'm writing to express my strong interest in transitioning my skills and contributing to a Power BI project. My experience in managing and optimizing databases positions me uniquely to understand the source data and build robust, efficient Power BI solutions.

I'm eager to embrace new challenges and believe that a move into Power BI would be a natural progression for me, allowing me to contribute to our organization's data-driven initiatives in a new capacity and I'm a quick learner, always ready to take on new challenges.

Could you please consider me for any Power BI projects where my skills, like data analysis, data visualization, and business intelligence, could be valuable? I'm available to discuss how I can best contribute at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
